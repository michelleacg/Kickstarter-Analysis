#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the Kickstarter Analysis is to help Louise make informed decisions for her theater campaign fundraising by analyzing historical data to find trends from the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, where project creators add incentives for different pledge amounts. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. 
We can see the  trend for theater where there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in June, but at the end of the year it's not as successful.
In conclusion June seems to be a good month to launch a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns. 
The most successful campaigns have a goal that is less than 1,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Sometimes when visualizing data, an individual could start thinking they want to see something, but endup wanting to see something completely different, which seems to be Louise's case, as she wanted to explore plays in the US, but she also wanted to explore specific plays in Edingburg. When there is so much data, there are multiple answers, to multiple questions, and the issue becomes to understand what can be relevant to the individual. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
