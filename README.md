#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the Kickstarter Analysis is to help Louise make informed decisions for her theater campaign fundraising by analyzing historical data from Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform where project creators add incentives for different pledge amounts. Here we will try to uncover hidden trends. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Louise estimates her play will cost $12,000
Theater campaings ar the most successful overall.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launchedWwe can see that theater follows the overall trend: there is a spike of successful campaigns that began in June, but that tapers off by the end of the year.
June seems to be a good omnth to launch a campaign 
Louise was specially interested on the play "Foresight" which shows that donations are very hight, and that it was active a little under a month. 
Failed campagined have much higher fundraising goals than successfule Kickstarter campaigns, but failed kickstarter campaignes are unsuccessul for reasons other than asking for too much money. 

Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter Campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
